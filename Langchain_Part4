WHAT IS MODEL-> THIS IS IN DEPTH PART FOR THE ONLY MODEL COMPONENT IN LANCHAIN
The model component in langchain is a cruicial part of the framework desgined to faciliate intereactions with variaous language models and embedding models 
Iska matlab kya hai ki model component hame facility provide kerwata hai different type of models se itneract kerne me like there are two of them one is language modes and another one is embedding models right 
As e also discussed wah is language model and embedding modelBut i also again expalin -> 
language model like LLms and chatbot in which text to text is there if we give input it returns the output as text foramte like chatgpt 
But in embeddding model it did the symentic search ok and we all know if you check out my previous documentation on it you know what is sementic search .
