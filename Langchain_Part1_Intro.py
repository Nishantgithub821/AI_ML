So Actually we follow the campusX channel beecause that would be the best channel i thought so 
2 → 3 → 4 → 6 → 7 → 8
→ 9 → 10 → 11
→ 12 → 13 → 14 → 15 → 16
→ 17
→ 18 → 19 → 20
This is videos watch order and the playlist link is here i

This is our structure of the studing the whole things right so first we start with the langchain then we go to langgraph and agentic ai right 

#So the first thing is introduction of longchain 
"""
LangChain is an open-source framework that helps in building LLM-based applications. It provides modular components and end-to-end tools that help developers build complex AI applications such as chatbots, question-answering systems, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), autonomous agents, and more.

Key Points:

It supports all major LLMs.

It simplifies the development of LLM-based applications.

It provides integration for all major tools.

It is open-source, free, and actively developed.

It supports a wide range of AI use cases.
"""
# Explanatino of each 5 points is
"""
1️⃣ Supports all major LLMs: LangChain sabhi tarah ke LLMs (OpenAI, Google, open-source, etc.) ke sath kaam karta hai bina app badle.

2️⃣ Simplifies development: LangChain me pehle se backend code aur boilerplate hota hai isliye zero se code likhne ki zarurat nahi padti aur time-cost bachta hai.

3️⃣ Tool integrations: LangChain databases, vector stores, APIs, tools aur external services ke sath easily integrate ho jata hai.

4️⃣ Open-source & free: LangChain free, open-source hai aur regularly new features aur updates milte rehte hain.

5️⃣ Wide AI use cases: LangChain chatbots, RAG, agents, Q&A systems, automation aur many AI applications support karta hai.

So we cover the things like linewise so waht is the order of that is 
1. Fundermantels 
a) what is lanchain 
b) odels 
c) prompts 
d) prompts 
e) parsing output 
f) runnables and LCEL
g) Chains 
H) Memory

2) RAG
a)Document Loaders 
b) text splitters 
c) embeddings 
d) vector  stores 
e) retrivers 
f) buidliign a rag application 

3) Agents 
a) Tools and Toolkits 
b) Tool calling 
c) Building an ai agents
