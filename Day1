DAY 1 OF Code [ HOW WE PERFORM BASIC THINGS ON GOOGLE COLLAB AND ALSO HOW WE INITLIALIZE ARRAY AND USE IT ]


#lets practice our maaths for ml
#First import numpy lib
import numpy as np
# let do addition,sub,ult,division onn two vectors okey
leta = np.array([1,2,3])
letb = np.array([5,6,7])
print(leta+letb)
print(leta-letb)
print(leta*letb)
print(leta/letb)

#now we see product or of a scaler to a vector okey let scaler = 3
print(3*leta)
a = 3
print(a*letb) # this way is not a scaler but for understanding that we also do this in this way
print(44*letb-33*leta)

#now wee check the length of the vector remember the underroot formula of length but here just comand
print(np.linalg.norm(leta))
print(np.linalg.norm(letb)) # this way we check the lenght now,
# now wee see the dot product okey
a = np.array([1,2])
b = np.array([-1,1])
#print(np.dot(dota,dotb))
c = np.dot(a,b)
print(c)

# now similar we do these all operations in three matrix also
#but dot product always happens in only two matrixes
d = np.array([[1,2,3,], [4,5,6],[7,8,9]])
print(d)
e = np.array([[0,0,8],[1,2,3],[2,3,4]])
print(e)
print(d+e)
print(d-e)
f =  np.linalg.inv(e) #  if we write d in the place of e it gives error because inverse of det 0 is not exists
print(f)

#Linear combination
#1 First we wee the vector adition with apha and beta
# now in vector addition we mulitply the vector with alpha and beta
# and we also give the value maybe not so
a = np.array([1,2,3])
b = np.array([2,3,4])
alpha = 3
beta = 5

print(alpha*a+beta*b)
