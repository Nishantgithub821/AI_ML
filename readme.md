# AI_ML
In this repo i upload my daily day to day learning and execution of the code step by step because of the reason of no one in youtube or anywhere actually teach how to learn it from scratch and in good way so i learn from my own way 
DAY1 DETAIL README : 
# AI / ML Interpretation of Linear Combination

# Imagine you are building a SIMPLE ML model (like linear regression)

# You have 3 features (inputs):
# v1 = user watched time (in hours)
# v2 = number of clicks
# v3 = device quality score

# Each feature contributes SOME AMOUNT to the final prediction

# AI's job:
# Find how important each feature is (weights)

# Final prediction formula:
# prediction = w1*v1 + w2*v2 + w3*v3

# This is EXACTLY a linear combination

# If data is clean and independent → exact solution exists
# If features are redundant → model breaks (singular matrix)
