Artificial Intelligence (AI)

AI is a branch of Computer Science that enables machines to think and act like humans by learning, reasoning, and recognizing images or speech.

Main Branches of AI

Machine Learning (ML)

Deep Learning (DL)

Robotics

Traditional System vs Machine Learning
Traditional Programming

Logic + Input → Program → Output

Machine Learning

Input + Output → Training → Model (learned logic)
New Input → Inference → Output

👉 Logic is learned from data, not written manually.

Machine Learning (ML)

ML allows systems to learn from data without explicit programming.

Types of ML Problems

Classification → Fixed output
Example: Spam / Not Spam

Regression → Continuous value
Example: House price prediction

Types of Learning
Supervised Learning

Data is labeled

Structured (tables)

Used for classification & regression

Unsupervised Learning

Data is unlabeled

Finds patterns automatically

Example: Clustering

Deep Learning (DL)

Uses Neural Networks

Learns via backpropagation (error correction multiple times)

When to Use What?

ML → Small data, limited compute, high interpretability

DL → Big data, images/audio/video, high compute power

Neural Network Architectures

FNN → Like a juicer (input → output, hidden process)

RNN → Like cooking step-by-step with feedback

CNN → Image understanding

Transformers → Context understanding (used in ChatGPT)

Deep Learning Tools

PyTorch (Meta) → Beginner friendly

TensorFlow (Google)

GPU → Needed for large-scale training

Generative AI (GenAI)

GenAI generates new content like text, images, audio, and video.

GenAI Models

Text → GPT, LLaMA, Gemini, Claude

Image → DALL-E, Stable Diffusion

Audio → MusicLM

Video → Sora

Traditional AI vs Generative AI
Traditional AI	Generative AI
Predicts / Classifies	Creates new content
Fixed output (Yes/No, Number)	Creative output (Text, Image, Music)
Decision Trees, SVM	LLMs, GANs, Diffusion
Task-specific	Human-like creativity
What are LLMs (Large Language Models)?

LLMs are like a super-powered parrot 🦜

Learns from massive text data

Predicts the next best word

Used by scientists, engineers, writers

Safety

RLHF ensures polite & safe responses

AI Agents & Agentic AI (High-Level)
RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)

LLM + Company private data

Example: Company policy chatbot

Tool-Augmented Systems

LLM + APIs

Example: Check leave balance & apply leave automatically

AI Agents

An AI Agent can:

Perceive environment

Make decisions

Take actions to achieve a goal

Agentic AI

Agentic AI = Multiple advanced agents working autonomously using:

Goal-oriented planning

Multi-step reasoning

Tool usage

Memory

Example:
Auto onboarding a new employee (email, ID card, laptop, HR system)

Generative AI vs Agentic AI (Final Difference)
Generative AI	Agentic AI
Generates content	Achieves goals
No autonomy	High autonomy
Single response per prompt	Multi-step actions
ChatGPT writing text	AI onboarding an employee
Reactive	Proactive

👉 GenAI is a part of Agentic AI
Agentic AI = GenAI + Reasoning + Tools + Autonomy
